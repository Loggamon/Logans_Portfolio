1.Include my name, headshot, about me section, portfolio section, and a way for them to contact me.
2.Have my portfolio images link to my other projects.
3.Have a working nav bar that directs them to the desired section.
4.Have my webpage be responsive depending on their viewing device.

##Pros and Cons
During this process, I learned that there are certain aspects that are really intuitive and make sense, and that there are some aspects that I need to work on.

Pros:
Navigation Bars are really fun to make, and the fact that there are so many different ways to make one and that I can drop it into another project and have it still work is really cool.
Sidebars are a really nice to segment a page, without actually breaking up the section pages, making it less cluttered.
Knowing that icons can be flexed, making my own icons for the website made i feel like the webpage was really mine.

Cons:
I should have commited everything to HTML first, BEFORE I maved on to CSS. Because of this, I had to retroactively fix the CSS every time I added more content to the HTML. This ended up taking way more time to fix than actually putting in the code.
Flexboxes are really fun, but when I have flexboxes inside of flexboxes, inside of flexboxes, it became difficult to make sure everything lined up and scaled decently.
My media queries are really weak. Once again, due to my convoluted code, it was hard for me to get the elements to do what I wanted.

In the future, I want to nail down the HTML, and then start over my CSS from scratch to see if I can weed out the unecessary code lingering in my CSS. That, and update my media queries so that i can reorient the elements to stack atop one another, like a yellow-green oreo.
